# Raster Intervals
Code for paper-id 140 "Raster Intervals"

will be uploaded here by 29.04.2022


## Description
This is an end-to-end implementation of a join operation between two polygon data sets. The MBR filter *CITE TSITSIGKOS?* generates the candidate pairs which move to the Raster Intervals intermediate filter. Their approximations are used there to identify true hits or true negatives and any indecisive pair cases are forwarded to the refinement step (plane sweep). There are options to i) generate the Raster Intervals approximations for the datasets ii) load existing approximations from disk to avoid the creation process and iii) skip the intermediate filter and/or refinement step in the pipeline.
